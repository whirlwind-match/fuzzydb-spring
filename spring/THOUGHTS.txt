Ok.  I seem to have hit the limit to how far I want to go without re-considering the choices made so far.

The implementation of AbstractConvertingRepository makes a few assumptions:
- the internal ID is of type: Ref<T>
- the external value marked @Id is null for objects that are not yet persisted

This can work if we use a transformation of Ref<T> as the external ID and convert it each way as necessary.
This eliminates the need to create an index @Key for Whirlwind items.

To this end, it looks like I should get rid of @Key(unique=true) in BlobStoringWhirlwindItem.
